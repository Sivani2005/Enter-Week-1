This repository consists of the AI project: Supply Chain Emissions Modeling Using Industry and Commodity Data (2010â€“2016)

Problem Statement:

You have annual supply chain emission data from 2010â€“2016 categorized into industries and commodities. The goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins based on descriptive and quality metrics (substance, unit, reliability, temporal/geographical/technological/data collection correlations, etc.).

GHG Emissions

Source:
Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors

Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview**
This dataset contains supply chain emission factors associated with various U.S. industries and commodities.

Key Columns:

Code: Industry classification code
Industry_Name: Name of the industry
Commodity: Item or commodity name
GHG_Emissions_kgCO2e: GHG emissions per unit (kg CO2 equivalent)
Units: Measurement units (e.g., [kg/2018 USD, purchaser price])
ðŸ§¹* Data Preprocessing*
Steps:

Handle missing values
Convert units where needed
Encode categorical features
Normalize/scale numeric columns
**ðŸ¤– Model Building & Evaluation**
We aim to predict GHG_Emissions_kgCO2e using regression models.

Models to try:

Linear Regression
Random Forest
Evaluation Metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
RÂ² Score
Steps:
Step 1: Import Required Libraries
Step 2: Load Dataset
Step 3: Data Preprocessing (EDA+Cleaning+Encoding)
Step 4: Training
Step 5: Prediction and Evaluation
Step 6: Hyperparameter Tuning
Step 7: Comapartive Study and Slecting the Best model
